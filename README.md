# Perceptual Control Theory
> A python library for creating perceptual control hierarchies.


With this library you can create and run simple or complex hierarchies of perceptual control systems as well as make use of the power of the Python platform and its rich set of packages.

In the context of this library a single control system comprising a perceptual, reference, comparator and output function is called a Node. The functions therein can be configured by the user.

A hierarchy is defined by a collection of nodes.
